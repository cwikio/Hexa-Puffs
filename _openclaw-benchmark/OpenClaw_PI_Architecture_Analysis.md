## What OpenClaw Is

OpenClaw is a self-hosted, local-first personal AI assistant built as a TypeScript monorepo (~40,000 lines, ~69 modules). It connects to 13+ messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage, Teams, Matrix, and more) through a single local Gateway process. The whole thing runs on your machine — no cloud dependency required.

At its core, OpenClaw is a hub-and-spoke system: one central WebSocket Gateway coordinates all messaging channels, agent sessions, tool executions, and native device connections. The agent runtime is built on top of the **Pi Agent Core library** (`@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`), a minimal coding agent framework created by Mario Zechner. This is the "Pi" in the architecture — the minimal agent that powers everything.

---

## 1. The Hub-and-Spoke Architecture

### The Gateway (Hub)

The Gateway is a WebSocket RPC server (default `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`) implemented across `src/gateway/`. It's the single control plane for the entire system:

```
                         ┌──────────────┐
                         │   Gateway    │
                         │  (WS:18789)  │
                         └──────┬───────┘
            ┌───────┬───────┬───┴───┬───────┬───────┐
            │       │       │       │       │       │
         Telegram WhatsApp Discord Slack  Signal  macOS
         adapter  adapter  adapter adapter adapter  app
```

The Gateway handles: session lifecycle (create, resolve, queue, dispatch), access control (DM policies, pairing, mention gating), webhook routing from external platforms, cron scheduling, and web dashboard serving.

Every client — CLI, web UI, native apps, headless nodes — connects over the same WebSocket protocol, declares its role and scope at handshake, and communicates via typed RPC frames.

### Channel Adapters (Spokes)

Each messaging platform gets an adapter in `src/<channel>/` or `extensions/<channel>/` that normalizes platform-specific messages into a unified envelope:

```json
{
  "body": "plain text message",
  "media": [{ "type": "image", "url": "...", "caption": "..." }],
  "sender": "normalized-sender-id",
  "channelId": "telegram|whatsapp|discord|...",
  "isGroupChat": true,
  "groupName": "My Group",
  "timestamp": 1707900000
}
```

Key adapters and their underlying libraries:

| Channel | Library | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Telegram | **grammY** | TypeScript Bot API framework |
| WhatsApp | **Baileys** | WebSocket connection to WhatsApp Web protocol |
| Discord | **discord.js** | Full Discord API client |
| Slack | **@slack/bolt** | Slack Bolt framework |
| Matrix | **@matrix-org/matrix-sdk-js** | With native crypto for E2E encryption |

Each adapter handles protocol normalization (stickers → images, embeds → media, reactions → text), access control enforcement, session routing to the correct agent, and bidirectional delivery (formatting responses back to platform constraints like character limits, threading, media support).

---

## 2. The Pi Agent Runtime: PiEmbeddedRunner

This is the heart of the system. Implemented in `src/agents/piembeddedrunner.ts`, it uses the Pi Agent Core library as its execution engine.

### The Four-Phase Loop

Every agent turn executes exactly four phases:

**Phase 1 — Session Resolution.** Load the serialized session state from disk. Sessions are stored as append-only JSONL files at `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/<session-id>.jsonl`.

**Phase 2 — Context Assembly.** This is where the system prompt is built fresh for every run. It merges:

| Source | What It Contains |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent instructions and operational guidelines |
| `SOUL.md` | Personality, tone, behavioral philosophy |
| `TOOLS.md` | Available tool definitions (auto-generated from registered tools) |
| `IDENTITY.md` | How the agent presents itself |
| `USER.md` | User context and preferences |
| `MEMORY.md` | References to persistent memories |
| Daily log | Timestamped events and interactions |
| Conversation history | Compacted if over threshold |
| Hybrid search results | BM25 + vector from SQLite memory |
| Skill definitions | Workspace, managed, or bundled skills |

The compiled prompt has a fixed section structure: Tooling → Safety → Skills → Self-Update → Workspace → Documentation → Sandbox → Injected Bootstrap Content.

**Phase 3 — Streaming Model Response with Inline Tool Execution.** This is the clever part. The runtime:

1. Streams tokens from the model provider (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, or fallback)
2. Watches the stream in real-time for `tool_use` blocks as they appear
3. Intercepts the tool call mid-generation
4. Executes the tool immediately (shell command, browser action, file operation, etc.)
5. **Backfills** the result directly into the ongoing generation
6. The model incorporates the result and continues reasoning
7. Repeats until the model signals completion (`NO_REPLY` or end-of-turn)

This is not a stop-generate-execute-regenerate loop. The tool execution happens *inline* with the streaming response. No round-trip latency — the model sees tool results as part of its own continuous generation.

**Phase 4 — State Persistence.** Write updated session to disk: new conversation entries, tool execution history, memory embeddings, session metadata.

### The Tool System

Tools are registered via `createOpenClawCodingTools()`, which combines Pi Coding Tools with OpenClaw-specific extensions:

**Pi Coding Tools** (from `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`):

| Tool | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `read(path)` | Read file contents |
| `write(path, content)` | Create or overwrite files |
| `edit(path, range, content)` | Modify existing files |
| `exec(command)` | Execute shell commands |
| `process` | Subprocess management |

**OpenClaw-Specific Tools:**

| Tool | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `browser` | Chrome DevTools Protocol automation — navigation, snapshots, actions |
| `canvas` | A2UI visual workspace rendering |
| `nodes` | Device control on macOS/iOS/Android companion apps |
| `cron` | Schedule recurring jobs |
| `sessions` | Create and spawn sub-agents |
| `message` | Send replies to users across channels |
| `memory` | Write durable memories before context compaction |

Tool execution goes through a policy check (seven-layer precedence hierarchy) before running. If a tool is denied at any level, it doesn't execute regardless of what the model requests. Tools can also run inside Docker sandbox containers depending on configuration.

---

## 3. Memory Architecture: SQLite-Powered Hybrid RAG

This is one of OpenClaw's strongest architectural decisions. The entire memory system runs on a single SQLite database — no external vector DB, no cloud service.

### Hybrid Search: BM25 + Vector Embeddings

OpenClaw combines two search approaches on the same data:

**Vector Search (Semantic Similarity):** Embeddings are generated for each memory chunk (512–1024 tokens) and stored via the `sqlite-vec` extension. Cosine similarity finds semantically related conversations — good for "find conversations about deployment strategies" even if the exact word "deployment" never appears.

**BM25 Search (Keyword Matching):** SQLite FTS5 full-text search for exact token matching. Excels at finding error codes, function names, unique identifiers — things that vectors are bad at.

**Hybrid Blend:** Results are ranked 70% vector similarity + 30% BM25 keyword score, using the union of both result sets (not intersection). A 4x candidate pool is sampled and then reranked.

### Context Window Compaction

When sessions approach token limits, a clever mechanism kicks in:

1. The runtime detects the token count approaching the context window size
2. It triggers a **silent agentic turn** — invisible to the user
3. The model is prompted to write important facts to durable memory via the `memory` tool
4. Older conversation history is auto-summarized to reduce tokens
5. The original turn continues after compaction

The key insight: memory is written *before* it's discarded, so nothing important is lost. And the memory system is file-first — all memories are stored as readable Markdown, not opaque embeddings. Users own their data completely.

---

## 4. Session Management: Lane Queues

OpenClaw's concurrency model is built on a lane queue system with the philosophy **"Default Serial, Explicit Parallel."**

Each session gets its own lane — an independent queue:

| Lane | Purpose | Default Concurrency |
|---|---|---|
| Main | Primary chat workflow | 4 |
| Cron | Scheduled jobs (isolated: `cron:<job_id>`) | 1 |
| Subagent | Child agent spawning | 8 |
| Nested | Nested tool calls within a run | 1 |

The enforcement flow:

```
runEmbeddedPiAgent enqueues by session key (lane: session:<key>)
    → Guarantees only one active run per session
    → Then queued into global lane (main by default)
    → Overall parallelism capped by agents.defaults.maxConcurrent
```

Messages within a session are processed serially by default — a second message waits until the first run completes. This prevents state corruption. Cross-session work runs in parallel up to the concurrency cap.

---

## 5. Multi-Agent Architecture

OpenClaw supports multiple agents with different models, tools, and workspaces — configured in `agents.json` / `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "list": [
      {
        "id": "main",
        "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
        "tools": { "allow": ["*"] },
        "subagents": { "allowAgents": ["research", "coding"] }
      },
      {
        "id": "research",
        "model": "openrouter/deepseek-r1-distill"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The main agent runs on an expensive model (Claude Opus 4.6 at ~$15/M tokens) and spawns sub-agents on cheaper models (DeepSeek R1 at ~$2.74/M tokens) for specific tasks. Each agent maintains isolated workspace, session history, and auth profiles.

**Model Failover:** If the primary model fails (auth, billing, rate limit), OpenClaw tries fallback models. OpenRouter can rotate through multiple provider API keys for redundancy.

**Cost gap:** OpenClaw currently lacks native cost controls — no built-in budgets, limits, or alerts. Third-party solutions (ClawWatcher, RelayPlane, Clawly) fill this gap. A KARMA framework has been proposed with monthly budgets, threshold alerts, and auto-blocking.

---

## 6. Monorepo Structure

---

## 7. Native Apps and Device Nodes

OpenClaw ships native apps for macOS (menu bar), iOS, and Android that connect to the Gateway as device nodes.

**Discovery:** Devices find the Gateway via **Bonjour/mDNS** (`_openclaw-gw._tcp`) on local network, or use explicit hostname/IP.

**Connection:** WebSocket to the Gateway (same protocol as CLI and web). Pairing handshake with approval codes for first-time connections.

**Capabilities:** Native apps provide camera/microphone access, voice wake-word detection, canvas rendering, chat interface, and push notifications. The `nodes` tool in the agent runtime can control these device capabilities.

**Remote access:** Tailscale Serve/Funnel for secure tunneling, SSH port forwarding (`ssh -L 18789:localhost:18789 user@remote`), or TLS reverse proxies.

---

## 8. The WebSocket Protocol: TypeBox Validation

All communication between Gateway, clients, and devices uses a strictly typed protocol defined in `src/gateway/protocol/schema.ts`:

```json
{ "type": "req", "id": 1, "method": "tool.exec", "params": {...} }
{ "type": "res", "id": 1, "ok": true, "payload": {...} }
{ "type": "event", "event": "message", "payload": {...}, "seq": 1, "stateVersion": 2 }
```

TypeBox schemas (`Type.Object()` with `additionalProperties: false`) validate every frame at runtime. The same schema definitions generate Swift types for the macOS app — single source of truth across platforms.

Live schema export: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclaw/openclaw/main/dist/protocol.schema.json`

---

## 9. Skills: Lazy Loading and Resolution

Skills are reusable agent behavior modules that extend capabilities. They resolve in priority order:

1. **Workspace skills** — `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/`
2. **Managed/local skills** — `~/.openclaw/managed-skills/`
3. **Bundled skills** — `node_modules/openclaw/skills/`
4. **Extra directories** — configured via `skills.load.extraDirs[]`

**Lazy loading:** On session start, OpenClaw snapshots eligible skills (filesystem scan + filtering) and caches the result with a version hash. Subsequent turns in the same session reuse the cached snapshot — no filesystem scan on every turn. Skill metadata (file paths only) is injected into the prompt, but actual `SKILL.md` content is loaded on-demand via the `read_file` tool. This keeps the context window lean.

Skills can be toggled on/off, supplied with environment variables, and allow/deny listed per agent.

---

## 10. Sandbox Architecture

Tool execution runs in one of three modes based on `agents.defaults.sandbox.mode`:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `"all"` | Every session gets an ephemeral Docker container |
| `"non-main"` | Main DM runs on host; group/channel sessions get containers |
| `"disabled"` | Everything on host |

Each container provides isolated filesystem, configurable network, CPU/memory limits. Containers are destroyed after execution.

---

## Pros and Cons

### What's Good

**Local-first, no cloud dependency.** The entire stack — Gateway, memory, sessions, embeddings — runs on SQLite on your machine. No vendor lock-in, no data leaving your network. This is a strong architectural choice for a personal assistant.

**The inline tool execution model.** Backfilling tool results into the streaming response without a stop-regenerate cycle is elegant. It reduces latency and makes the agent feel responsive. Most agent frameworks use a loop-and-restart pattern — Pi's inline approach is measurably faster.

**Hybrid RAG on SQLite.** Combining BM25 keyword search with vector embeddings in a single SQLite database is pragmatic engineering. No Pinecone, no Weaviate, no infrastructure overhead. The 70/30 blend and union-based ranking handles both semantic queries and exact lookups well.

**The channel adapter pattern.** Normalizing 13+ messaging protocols into a single envelope format is clean and extensible. Adding a new channel means implementing one adapter, not touching the core.

**TypeBox schema validation.** Single source of truth for types across TypeScript server, WebSocket protocol, and Swift native apps. Runtime validation catches protocol errors before they reach handlers. This is solid engineering for a multi-platform system.

**Lane queue concurrency model.** Default-serial-per-session prevents state corruption without sacrificing cross-session parallelism. Simple, correct, and hard to misuse.

### What's Not Great

**No native cost controls.** For a system that can spawn sub-agents and make unlimited API calls, having zero built-in budgets or limits is a real gap. Third-party solutions exist, but this should be core functionality.

**Single-process Gateway.** The hub-and-spoke model means the Gateway is a single point of failure. If the process crashes, all channels go down. There's no clustering, no horizontal scaling, no failover. Fine for personal use — problematic if you're running this for a team.

**Native dependency complexity.** `node-pty`, `sqlite-vec`, `node-llama-cpp`, `sharp`, `@napi-rs/canvas` — all require native compilation. This makes installation fragile across platforms and Node versions. The pnpm workspace setup helps, but native deps remain a pain point.

**Monorepo scale.** 69+ modules in `src/`, separate `packages/`, `extensions/`, `apps/`, `skills/` directories. The codebase is large and navigation isn't always obvious. Documentation exists but doesn't fully map the module graph.

**Context file proliferation.** SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md — seven files consumed on every turn. These eat tokens on every request, and the distinction between some of them (AGENTS.md vs IDENTITY.md, for instance) is unclear. A simpler configuration surface would help.

**MCP integration is limited.** OpenClaw can connect to MCP servers, but the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) explicitly disables MCP for HTTP/SSE transports. Workarounds exist (mcporter CLI), but the integration isn't seamless.

---

## Bottom Line

OpenClaw's architecture is that of a well-engineered personal infrastructure project that grew into something much bigger. The Pi agent core — minimal, stream-first, inline tool execution — is genuinely good design. The SQLite-powered hybrid RAG is pragmatic and effective. The channel adapter pattern scales well.

The weaknesses are what you'd expect from a project that started as one person's assistant: single-process, no cost controls, complex native dependencies, and a configuration surface that's grown organically rather than being designed top-down. None of these are fatal — they're the natural tradeoffs of a local-first system optimized for power users over enterprise deployments.
